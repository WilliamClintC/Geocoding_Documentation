  This report documents the geocoding of U.S. truck stop data, addressing challenges from inconsistent address formats. Using phone number matching and structured data from Truck Stops and Services, Yelp, Yellow Pages, and iExit, we achieved a 99.19% match rate. A custom interface was developed to support manual verification and ensure data accuracy.

# Introduction

This document is prepared for Prof. Ron Yang, who will be returning to meet at July 16 2025, 11:00 AM PST. It outlines the current progress of the geocoding task and is intended to provide context for discussion and feedback.

# Setup

We are working with a dataset that includes truck stop details. However, the dataset lacks geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). The objective of this project is to extract and assign accurate coordinates to each entry.

The main challenge arises from the inconsistent formatting of addresses. Some entries contain full addresses, while others include only road names, highway exits, or mile markers. The lack of standardization complicates automated geocoding.

The dataset also required extensive data cleaning to be useful.

# Approaches

## Google (Initial) Approach

The first approach involved directly submitting address strings to the Google Maps APIs (Geocoding and Places). However, this method encountered several limitations:

-   The API struggled with inconsistent or non-standard address formats.
-   We could not reliably verify the accuracy of returned locations.
-   Many addresses returned irrelevant or incorrect coordinates.

### Methods Tried With Google (Initial) Approach

-   Constraining search to specific regions (both hard and soft constraints).
-   Using the Nearby Search function (by place type and radius).
-   Cleaning and standardizing address strings before submission.
-   Exploring and comparing the Google Geocoding and Places APIs.

Although the Google API offers convenience, it lacks reliability in the context of our dataset. In the interest of time no further detail about this project will be mentioned. 

## Truck Stops and Services Website (Second) Approach

The second approach leverages a standardized and reliable feature of our dataset: phone numbers. These are consistently formatted and can be used to match entries with external data sources. We utilized two key websites for this task:

-   [Truck Stops and Services](https://www.truckstopsandservices.com/)
-   [RV and Travelers Directory](http://www.rvandtravelers.com/)

This would be an example of the webpage:

The complete data available from this scraping is available in [Appendix: Truck Stops and Services/ RV and Travelers Data Dictionary](#truck-stops-and-services-rv-and-travelers-data-dictionary). Most notably, we observe directly the latitude and longitude, directly along with phone and the name of the stop.

What is also to note is that some Trucker's friend entries only appear in the RV and Travelers Directory and not in Truck Stops and Services. 

Both websites maintain structured records that include phone numbers, making them effective for cross-referencing. Using these sources, we employed two main matching strategies:

1.  **Phone Number Matching**: Directly matching entries based on phone numbers.
2.  **Place Name to ZIP Code Matching**: This strategy involves a hierarchical matching process. First, the state or ZIP code must match. Next, the city or highway exit must match. After that, the road name must match. Finally, the business or place name must match.

This approach improved match rates compared to the first method and provided a more verifiable matching process.

## Yelp (Third) Approach

The third approach leverages the Yelp API, which is unique in allowing phone number-based search queries. This feature makes it particularly well-suited to our dataset, which contains standardized phone numbers.
An example of the Yelp website interface is shown below:

::: {.figure}
![Example of the Yelp website interface](images/Screenshot%202025-07-16%20013928.png){fig-alt="Yelp Example 1" width="80%"}

::: {.figure}
![Another example of the Yelp website interface](images/Screenshot%202025-07-16%20013953.png){fig-alt="Yelp Example 2" width="80%"}
:::

The full list of data fields extracted from Yelp is available in the [Appendix: Yelp Data Dictionary](#yelp-data-dictionary). Most notably, we observe, place name, latitude, longitude and **weather a place is still active**. Active/inactive designation is a uncommon and useful field of this dataset. 

## Yellow Pages (Fourth) Approach

We further improved our match rate using [YellowPages](https://www.yellowpages.com/), which also allows direct phone number queries through web scraping. Examples of the website interface are shown below:

::: {.figure}
![Example of the YellowPages website interface](images/Screenshot%202025-07-16%20011959.png){fig-alt="YellowPages Example 1" width="80%"}
:::

::: {.figure}
![Another example of the Yellow Pages website interface](images/Screenshot%202025-07-16%20012037.png){fig-alt="YellowPages Example 2" width="80%"}
:::

 The full list of data fields extracted from Yellow Pages is available in the [Appendix: Yellow Pages Data Dictionary](#yellow-pages-data-dictionary). Most notably, we observe, place name, latitude, longitude and phone.

This approach reduced the unmatched entries to 19, making manual verification a feasible next step.

### Matching Summary Table

This data is for the 4 states, all years present aside from 2017.

|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| Truck Stops and Services Phone number matching                                            | 1,795         | 2,333          | 76.94%      | 538              |

## Current Project: iExit Integration

Since the project's goal is to match latitude and longitude data to exit locations, a comprehensive dataset of U.S. highway exits is essential. To my knowledge, iExit is the most complete single source currently available online. **(Your insights on this would be valuable.)** Example of the Exit image website is as follows.

::: {.figure}
![Example of the iExit website interface](images/Screenshot%202025-07-16%20024438.png){fig-alt="iExit Example" width="80%"}
:::

The full list of data fields is available in the [Appendix: iExit Data Dictionary](#iexit-data-dictionary). Most notably, we observe highway, exit, latitude, longitude and **direction of travel**.
Direction of travel is to be emphasized. This is a unique piece of information not available elsewhere. 

## Utilities Developed

To support manual validation, we developed a custom GUI tool to assist future research assistants. This interface displays two columns original dataset vs. matched results side by side, allowing quick visual inspection and correction without requiring coding experience. Image of the program is as follows.

## Term of Use Check

To address concerns related to anti-scraping compliance, PDF copies of the following websites have been archived and are available at the [Geocoding Documentation Repository](https://github.com/WilliamClintC/Geocoding_Documentation/tree/main/documents):

- Truck Stops and Services  
- RV and Travelers Directory  
- Yellow Pages  
- iExit

Yellow Pages includes clauses that may limit scraping or data extraction. Google and Yelp are of limited concern, given that we were approved API access. Truck Stops and Services, RV and Travelers Directory and iExit do not impose or mention any restrictions on scraping.

## Next Steps

1.   Finalize code cleaning for future reproducibility. **Given the volume of code involved, this task is expected to require a significant amount of time.**
2.   Conduct manual verification of the remaining 19 unmatched entries.
3.   Conduct robustness checks on the finalized data.
4.   Discuss Yellow Pages Terms of Use and Data Policy

     ![Screenshot of Yellow Pages Terms of Use](images/Screenshot%202025-07-16%20063400.png){fig-alt="Yellow Pages Terms of Use" width="80%"}

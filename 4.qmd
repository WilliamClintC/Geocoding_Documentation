  This report documents the geocoding validation process, highlighting discrepancies arising from integrating data sources like Yelp and Yellow Pages. Despite matching entries by phone number, these platforms introduce a high rate of false positives. We apply a variety of filtering to correct for this. We then provide a detailed account of the types of errors observed and offer a numerical estimate of the remaining discrepancies. These errors represent a small proportion of the entire dataset, affecting approximately 17 locations.
